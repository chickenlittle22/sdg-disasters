  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>This project was created to raise awareness about natural disasters and their impact on communities. We wanted to combine information with an interactive game to make learning more engaging. Instead of just reading facts, users can explore and apply what they learn in a fun way. The project connects education, technology, and global goals.</p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Our mission is to educate people about natural disasters and promote preparedness. We believe that knowledge can save lives. Through our website and game, we want to encourage people to understand risks, recognize warning signs, and take action before disasters happen. By spreading awareness, we hope to support safer and more resilient communities.</p>

  <h2>Why Natural Disaster Awareness?</h2>
  <p>We chose natural disaster awareness because disasters are becoming more frequent and severe in many parts of the world. Climate change, population growth, and urban development can increase the risks. Many disasters cannot be prevented, but their impact can be reduced with preparation and education. Teaching people what to do before, during, and after a disaster can make a huge difference.</p>
