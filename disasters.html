<h2>Earthquakes</h2>
<p>Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates beneath the Earth’s surface suddenly move. This movement releases energy that causes the ground to shake. Warning signs are not always clear, but small tremors can sometimes happen before a larger quake. During an earthquake, it is important to drop, cover, and hold on under sturdy furniture and stay away from windows.</p>

<h2>Hurricanes</h2>
<p>Hurricanes form over warm ocean water when moist air rises and creates a powerful rotating storm system. They can bring strong winds, heavy rain, and flooding. Hurricanes are very dangerous because they can last for days and affect large areas. If a hurricane is approaching, people should follow evacuation orders, secure their homes, and prepare emergency supplies.</p>

<h2>Tornadoes</h2>
<p>Tornadoes form during severe thunderstorms when warm and cold air masses collide, creating a spinning column of air. They are extremely dangerous but usually last for a short time. Tornadoes can destroy buildings and send debris flying at high speeds. The safest action during a tornado is to go to a basement or an interior room with no windows and protect your head.</p>

<h2>Floods</h2>
<p>Floods happen when there is too much water in an area, often caused by heavy rainfall, hurricanes, or melting snow. Water can rise quickly and cover roads and homes. Floods are dangerous because they can sweep people and cars away. It is important to move to higher ground and never walk or drive through floodwaters.</p>

<h2>Wildfires</h2>
<p>Wildfires are large fires that spread quickly across forests or grasslands. They can start naturally from lightning or from human activities like unattended campfires. Dry weather and strong winds make them spread faster. Wildfires are dangerous because they destroy homes, wildlife, and pollute the air. If a wildfire is near, follow evacuation orders immediately.</p>

<h2>Tsunamis</h2>
<p>Tsunamis are large ocean waves usually caused by underwater earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. These waves can travel across oceans and grow taller as they reach shore. A warning sign of a tsunami can be the ocean suddenly pulling back from the coastline. If you are near the coast and feel a strong earthquake, move to higher ground immediately.</p>
