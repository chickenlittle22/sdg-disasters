<h1>SDG 1.5: Climate Action</h1>
<p>Protecting our planet starts with awareness.</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
<h2>What Is SDG 1.5?</h2>
<p>SDG 1.5 is part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals created by the United Nations. SDG 1 focuses on ending poverty, and Target 1.5 aims to reduce the vulnerability of poor and vulnerable populations to climate-related extreme events and natural disasters. It highlights the importance of building resilience so communities can recover faster after disasters.</p>

<h2>How It Relates to Natural Disasters</h2>
<p>Natural disasters often affect low-income communities the most because they may not have strong infrastructure, savings, or emergency resources. SDG 1.5 connects to disaster awareness because reducing risk helps prevent people from falling deeper into poverty after disasters. Preparedness, education, and resilience planning all support this goal.</p>

<h2>Targets of SDG 1.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen resilience to climate hazards</li>
<li>Integrate climate measures into policies</li>
<li>Improve education and awareness</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
<p>You can help by learning about disasters in your area and creating an emergency plan for your family. Prepare a disaster supply kit with food, water, and first aid supplies. Stay informed about weather alerts and evacuation routes. You can also spread awareness by sharing information and supporting policies that improve disaster preparedness in your community.</p>
